How-to
=====
First off in order to restore the BLJ in 3DAS, you're going to need those 3 things listed above.
Lets dump the SM64 Rom first. There is 2 ways you can get this file, either dumping it or finding it in my... spicy google drive.

If you choose the safe way by dumping it you can follow this tutorial below

__How to dump__

First drag and drop nxdumptool.nro into the SD Card:/switch/ folder

Next open the app with the hbmenu (If you have the gamecard make sure its inserted)

Now select the option that you need based off if the game is installed to your SD Card or if you have the gamecard, very straight forward
(If you selected SD Card scroll until you find the game and open it)

Now select `RomFS options > Browse RomFS section > [The second option](ID Offset: 1) > rom > Stardust_JP`

On this screen you should see lots of files and one folder, select the .bin files that starts with 01
